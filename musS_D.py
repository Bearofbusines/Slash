TODO:
    6-fnt alert user when songs were unable to be added inside _playlist()
    5- rearrange functions, their order here decides what order they show up in when people type / in discord
    3- clean up todos in various parts of code
    2- write pydocs
    -make more commands
        1- create add-at(?) (merge with playtop? ask for int instead of bool?)
        1- help #bear //done but needs to be updated
        1- settings #bear
        1- move command #bear 
        1- write pause and play methods in player to consolidate controlls into one place
    -other
        9- add info on permissions to help
        7-fnt DJ role to do most bot functions, users without can still queue songs (! top), join bot to channel, etc.
        5- rename get_embed's content argument to description
        


DONE:
    9-f make listener for player.start returning to call clean() // found alternative that probably works better
    9-f fix automatic now_playing messages
    8-f make forceskip admin-only
    8-f make play and playlist only join VC if the provided queries are valid (prevents bot from joining to just do nothing)
    8-f make YTDLInterface.query_link calls cognizant of entries[] and able to handle it's appearance
    8-f likewise, make query_search able to handle a lack of entries[] // Never going to happen; (hopefully) a non issue
    7-fnt create general on_error event method
     - make more commands
        9-f pause #bear //vc.pause() and vc.resume()
        9-f resume #bear
        9-f now #bear
        9-f skip (force skip) #sming
        8-f search #sming
        8-f queue #bear
        8-f remove #bear
        8-f play_top #bear
        7-f remove user's songs from queue
        7-f play_list #sming
        7-f play_list_shuffle #sming
        6-f clear #bear
        5-f shuffle #bear
        4-f loop (queue, song) #bear
        1-f fix queue emojis being backwards
        1-f option to decide if __send_np goes into vc.channel or song.channel #sming
        1-f remove_duplicates #bear (sming finished it)
        1-f remove author's songs from queue when author leaves vc #sming //can't be done until we have settings

     - Be able to play music from youtube
        - play music
        - stop music
    (kind but found a better way)- get downloading to work
     - Be able to join vc and play sound
        - join vc
        - leave vc
        - play sound
    - other
        9-f footer that states the progress of the song #bear
        8-f author doesn't need to vote to skip#sming
        8-f fix auto now playing messages not deleting //found why, it's because the player.wait_until_termination() returns instantly once we tell the player to close
        8-f auto-leave VC if bot is alone #sming
        7-f only generate a player when audio is playing, remove the player_event, force initialization with a Song or Queue
        6-f Implement discord.Button with queue
        5-f access currently playing song via player.song rather than player.queue.top() (maybe remove current song from queue while we're at it?)
        4-f remove unneeded async defs
        3-f make it multi server #bear
