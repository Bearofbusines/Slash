class VoiceError(Exception):
    """Generic voice error class."""

class Player:
    """
    A class that handles Song population and playback as well as Queue management for a guild.
    
    If a Player ever has no Song to play it will die, remove itself from the Servers class and disconnect from its vc.

    ...

    Attributes
    ----------
    queue : `Queue`
        The Queue that the Player is responsible for.
    song : `Song` | `None`
        The song that is currently playing, if there is not one this is a NoneType.
        This is slightly innacurate as to when the Player is actually playing audio, is_playing() should be used instead.
    last_np_message: `discord.Message` | `None`
        The last automatic now-playing Message the Player has sent.  NoneType if it has not sent one.
    looping : `bool`
        Whether the Player is looping the currently playing Song.
    queue_looping : `bool`
        Whether the Player is looping the Queue.
    true_looping : `bool`
        Whether the Player is shuffling completed Songs back into the Queue.
    vc : `discord.VoiceClient`
        The VoiceClient this Player is managing.
    send_location : `discord.abc.GuildChannel`
        The location the bot will send auto Now Playing messages.  Updated every song.

    Methods
    -------
    async clean():
        Cleans up and closes the player.
    is_playing():
        Whether the player is playing audio or in-between songs. Pausing the Song does not effect this.
    pause():
        Pauses the player.
    resume():
        Resumes the player
    set_loop(state: `bool`):
        Sets whether the Player should be looping the Song at song.
    set_true_loop(state: `bool`):
        Sets whether the Player should be shuffling completed Songs back into the Queue.
    set_queue_loop(state: `bool`):
        Sets whether the Player should be adding completed Songs to the end of the Queue.
